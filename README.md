Notes on different subjects for my referral.

1. stackoverflow.md - My StackOverflow Q&A + other stuff I figured out while having to solve problems.

2. Arraymethods.md - (Higher order functions / array methods with JavaScript) - Content provided by syntax podcast.

3. Playing with Multidimensional Arrays and other types of things that would be annoying to iterate through.
